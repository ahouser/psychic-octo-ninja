#My First GIT Repository

Taking a class hosted by Girl Develop It Pittsburgh on 6 December 2014. This is my first GIT repository.

##Let's Get Started!

*Markdown* is profoundly cool. Why?

- It's easy.
- It provides great results.

Let's make a list:

1. First
1. Second
1. Third

That was pretty easy, wasn't it?

Let's make more changes!

#Star Spangled Banner

Oh say can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming
